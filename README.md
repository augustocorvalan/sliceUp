# Redux Shell

Built on top of the skeleton of [Essential React](https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react)

To start developing you will need Node (v4.4.4) and npm installed. Navigate to top level folder and do an `npm install`. Runs off of webpack + babel (for ES6). Pertinent commands:

+ `npm run server` - Runs the dev server
+ `npm run build` - Creates a production build

The app is built on React, uses Redux as a framework, postCSS for styling. Tries to adhere to [Dan Abramov's smart and dumb component philosophy](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
