# SliceUp

An exploration of HTML5 video media fragments, SliceUp is an application that allows a user to create clips from a video.

Built on top of the skeleton of my [Redux Shell](https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react), utilizes:

+ React/Redux
+ postCSS
+ webpack + babel

To run, make sure you run `npm install` first, then:

+ `npm run server` - Runs the dev server
+ `npm run build` - Creates a production build
