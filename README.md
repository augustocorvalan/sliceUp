# SliceUp

An exploration of HTML5 video media fragments, SliceUp is an application that allows a user to create clips from a video.

Adheres closely to Dan Abramov's idea of [Smart and Dumb components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.k89broola). Built on top of the skeleton of my [Redux Shell](https://github.com/augustocorvalan/Redux-Shell). Utilizes:

+ React/Redux
+ postCSS
+ webpack + babel

To run, make sure you `npm install` first, then:

+ `npm run server` - Runs the dev server (port 8080)
+ `npm run build` - Creates a production build
